### installation

1. use your favorite plugin manager or put the file `colors/pride.vim` in `~/.vim/colors/`
2. add the following lines to your .vimrc
```
set t_Co=256
colorscheme pride
```

### help

##### the colors are not showing up as they should

* make sure you have set `t_Co` correctly, see installation

* make sure you are not setting any configuration that will trigger a reload of the default colorscheme after pride is loaded, e.g. `:set background=dark`
